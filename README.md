## [Project 1 : Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Heart-Disease-prediction)
Machine learning model for predicting heart disease. I made some explatory data analysis on the data then used 3 models and tested them (KNN, RandomForestClassifier, logisticRegression) after evaluating them, logistic regression achieved the best score in each evaluation metric.

## [Project 2 : Predicting sale prices of bulldozers](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Predicting-sale-prices-of-bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning)
Machine learning model for predicting auction prices of bulldozers (It was posted on Kaggle). I made some EDA on the data and preprocessed it. I used the RandomForestRegressor which from my point of view was the best , I did some tuning and it scored RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) = 2.46033 on validation data.
