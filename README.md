## [House Insurance claim Prediction](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Nigeria-Insurance-Prediction)
predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. I Cleaned the data , made some EDA then applied some feature engineering the model scored 0.707 on Zindi and placed in the top 30%

## [FIFA 19 Players analysis](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/FiFa19-Analysis)
FIFA 19 players and popular clubs analysis and visualizations.

## [Predicting sale prices of bulldozers](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Predicting-sale-prices-of-bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning)
Machine learning model for predicting auction prices of bulldozers (It was posted on Kaggle). I made some EDA on the data and preprocessed it. I used the RandomForestRegressor which from my point of view was the best , I did some tuning and it scored RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) = 2.46033 on validation data.

## [Dog Breed Identification](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Dog-breed-identification)
 Deep learning model to determine the breed of a dog in an image using tensorflow, in this project i used mobilenetv2 classifier model from tensorflow.
 I preprocessed the images and turned them into tensors and trained my model on them. The model scored 0.96446 on kaggle.

## [Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Heart-Disease-prediction)
Machine learning model for predicting heart disease.
I made some explatory data analysis on the data then used 3 models and tested them (KNN, RandomForestClassifier, logisticRegression) after evaluating them,  logistic 
regression achieved the best score in each evaluation metric.

## [Text to Speech](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Text-to-Speech-using-python)
 Convert given text or PDF to speech, plays it and saves it as mp3 file.

## [Python Projects](https://github.com/IyadAli-crypto/Python-Projects)
Projects I made while learning python.
